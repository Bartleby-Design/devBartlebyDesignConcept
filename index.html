                I created UX Design Solutions as a means of keeping in touch with the Manchester
                design community during lockdown. <a href="https://www.meetup.com/UX-Design-Solutions-Manchester/">UXDS</a>
                has since grown into a thriving community of creative professionals across the UK and we're
                always on the lookout for new members. If you are interested, follow the link below and I look
                forward to seeing you at the next meetup!

                Considering UX Design and Visual Design are often confused, I blur the lines that
                little bit more by practising both. Follow the main link to view my collections, or

                    Over the years I have completed both front and back end designs for a wide

            <h3>Content Writing and Blogs</h3>
            <p>
                It's not uncommon for a company to take for granted the importance of well written, proffessional
                content to help portray the correct tone and message to their customers.
                <br>
                High quality copywriting is an increadibly powerful sales tool and something I both specialise
                in and enjoy creating.

            <h3>Project Management</h3>
            <p>
                With experience delivering numerous digital projects in both Waterfall and Agile formats
                as well as being a certified Prince2 and Prince2 Agile Practitioner.
                <br>
                Whatever your requirements are, I am more than comfortable delivering anything from a Lean Startup to a complex, multi-dependancy
