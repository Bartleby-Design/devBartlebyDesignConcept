        <p>
            It's been 7 years since I hung up by Tractor Battery selling hat and jumped into the world of tech
            with both feet.
            <br>
            Back in 2013 I was what you would call an amature geek. I had built my own PC with the help of friends
            but had very little experience of working in the tech sector unil I joined a young startup called Indeispring.
            <br><br>
            With the freedom to pursue my own interests, and a positive, excited young team to work alongside I soon
            discovered my talents for Design and UX. Being a small company with only 4 employees, everyone wore multiple
            hats, and aside from Design, I was also the account manager and Project Manager for the first few years.
            <br><br>
            As we grew and took on more people, we were able to specialise in our chosen fields. I first branched out
            into Project Management and UX Design before finally being able to focus entirely on UX and Design at the
            start of 2020.
            <br><br>
            Then COVID hit...
            <br><br>
            Placed on furlough from July, and with very little new design work coming in, It looked as though no sooner
            had I acheived my dream of being a full time creative designer that it would be snatched away by a cruel
            twist of fate.
            <br>
            However, with every crisis comes oportunity and so I founded Bartleby Design to take my work freelance and
            continue pursuing the dream.
            <br><br>
            That's enough about me though. Tell me more about yourself.
